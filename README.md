# Java 1.8 Fibonacci implementation
A simple java project that implements a recursive and iterative method of calculating a Fibonacci sequence.

Iterative version has an implementation for long and BigInteger variables.

The recursive method is very resource-intensive. For bigger numbers I encourage to use an iterative method.
